# GunshopRedesign

Redesign of existing website for a gunshop in North Carolina. Contains some demo pages from existing website as well as what the website could look like following redesign. Design choices implemented to make a more user-friendly, visually appealing webpage. Design elements include:

1. Navigation Bar, Breadcrumbs & Search option
2. User interest items moved to home page for quick access.
3. Visual display of items in stock with option to select for details.
4. Page navigation for inventory items (25 per page vs scrolling down for all items)
5. Footer to include business contact info and disclaimer on all pages.
